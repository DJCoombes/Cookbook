## N'duja Harissa Pasta

Ignite your tastebuds with our Nduja Harissa Pasta, a fiery dish that brings together flavors from the heart of Italy and the spice-scented lanes of North Africa. The bold taste of Nduja, a spicy, spreadable pork salumi from Italy, forms the bedrock of this tantalizing recipe, while a dollop of Harissa adds an exotic, smoky warmth. The inherent sweetness of cherry tomatoes and rich passata offer a luscious counterbalance, enhanced by the deep undertone of tomato puree. Sautéed shallot and garlic lend their characteristic edge to the mix, rounded off with a classic seasoning of salt and pepper. Swirling amidst this mouth-watering concoction is your preferred pasta - we recommend Trofie, whose spiral shape lovingly embraces the sauce. This Nduja Harissa Pasta is more than a dish - it's an adventure.
